You’re working on a new messaging app.
Product wants to introduce a soft hourly message limit (e.g., 100 messages per hour) to reduce spam.

If a user goes over the limit, they should see a non-blocking warning (“You’ve sent a lot of messages. You’ll be able to send more soon.”)
If they repeatedly go over, the system should start rate-limiting them (e.g., delays or temporary lockouts).

Can you walk me through how you’d architect this feature across the stack — backend and mobile?
Feel free to clarify anything as needed.
