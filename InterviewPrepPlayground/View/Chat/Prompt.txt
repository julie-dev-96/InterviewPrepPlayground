üßë‚Äçüíª iOS Practical Interview Prompt

Prompt:
"Build a simple SwiftUI chat interface that supports:

A scrollable list of chat messages, with clear visual distinction between incoming and outgoing messages.

An input bar fixed at the bottom with a text field and a send button.

Automatically scrolls to the latest message when a new one is sent.

Messages should be stored in a @State or @StateObject and displayed with dynamic sizing.

(Bonus) Add a typing indicator when the user starts entering text."

Time limit: 30‚Äì45 minutes.

Evaluation Criteria:

UI structure and layout using SwiftUI best practices

ViewModel usage and state management

Reusability and separation of concerns

Accessibility considerations

Smooth scrolling and keyboard handling


** RESULTS **

Time Taken: ~43 minutes

Pain Points:
- Took me a little too long to think of the HStack for aligning messages in chat view
- Don't like the frame maxHeight solution for the textfield. Overall text field is ugly.
